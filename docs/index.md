# Pinax Badges Documentation

[Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) is an open source ecosystem
of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates.

As a reusable Django app, `pinax-badges` provides the ecosystem with
a well tested, documented, and proven badges application for awarding badges
to users in Django.

It provides simple abstractions over awarding users badges for completing tasks,
including multi-level badges, and repeatable badges, making it super simple to
add badges to a Django project.

!!! note
    It was built by [Eldarion](http://eldarion.com) as `brabeion` for use in
    [Typewar](http://typewar.com) and donated to Pinax in August 2017.
